## CitrusFarm Dataset
CitrusFarm is a multimodal agricultural robotics dataset that provides both **multispectral images** and **navigational sensor data** for localization, mapping and crop monitoring tasks.
- It was collected by a wheeled mobile robot in the [Agricultural Experimental Station](https://cnas.ucr.edu/resources/agricultural-experiment-station) at the [University of California Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/) in the summer of 2023.
- It offers a total of **nine** sensing modalities, including stereo RGB, depth, monochrome, near-infrared and thermal images, as well as wheel odometry, LiDAR, IMU and GPS-RTK data.
- It comprises seven sequences collected from three citrus tree fields, featuring various tree species at different growth stages, distinctive planting patterns, as well as varying daylight conditions.
- It spans a total operation time of 1.7 hours, covers a total distance of 7.5 km, and constitutes 1.3 TB of data.
