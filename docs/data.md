## Mobile Robot Platform
We employ the Clearpath Jackal wheeled mobile robot to collect multi-sensor data in the agricultural fields.
The sensor setup on the robot is illustrated in the figure below (left).
The corresponding reference frames are highlighted in the figure below (right).
Red, green and blue bars denote x, y and z axes respectively. They are generated in RViz using real calibrated extrinsic parameters.
